Got it ✅ — let’s first make a clear document that captures everything we’ve discussed so far. I’ll write it like a hackathon design note: simple enough to read, but complete in detail.

📘 Next-Gen Marketer: Multi-Agent Hackathon Design
1. 🎯 Goal
Build a multi-agent AI system that not only recommends past successful campaigns but can also generate new campaign ideas. The system uses:
	• Specialized agents for Sentiment, Purchase, and Campaign analysis.
	• An Orchestrator to decide which agents to use based on the user query.
	• A Marketer (Creative) Agent that synthesizes insights and generates new campaign proposals.
	• RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with CSV → Vector DB → LLMs.

2. 🗂 Data & RAG
	• Input data is in CSVs:
		○ Sentiment Data → customer feedback, social posts.
		○ Purchase Data → orders, products, segments.
		○ Campaign Data → historical campaign performance (CTR, conversions).
	• Each row of CSV is turned into text:
"Product: Shoes | Segment: Tier1 | Note: Repeat purchase high"
	• Text → embedded using Sentence-Transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2).
	• Stored in ChromaDB with separate namespaces:
		○ sentiment, purchase, campaign.

3. 🤖 Agents
a) Sentiment Agent
	• Queries only the sentiment namespace.
	• Analyzes customer mood & tone.
	• Uses LLM to:
		○ Pick relevant campaigns/products.
		○ Assign a confidence score (0–1).
		○ Provide rationale + supporting evidence.
b) Purchase Agent
	• Queries the purchase namespace.
	• Analyzes buying behavior (RFM, repeat purchases).
	• Uses LLM to suggest campaigns/products with confidence scores.
c) Campaign Agent
	• Queries the campaign namespace.
	• Analyzes past campaign performance (CTR, channels).
	• Uses LLM to suggest which strategies worked, with scores.
d) Marketer (Creative) Agent
	• Takes all agent outputs (structured + evidence).
	• Generates a new campaign idea, not just re-ranking old ones.
	• Output includes:
		○ Campaign Name
		○ Product
		○ Region/Segment
		○ Concept (theme)
		○ Channels
		○ Content Brief

4. 🧠 Orchestrator
The brain that:
	1. Reads the user’s query.
	2. Decides which agents to invoke:
		○ “Top 5 campaigns based on sentiment” → Sentiment Agent only.
		○ “Strategy using sentiment + purchase” → Sentiment + Purchase Agents.
		○ “Overall best strategy” → All 3 Agents.
	3. Collects their outputs.
	4. Passes them to the Marketer Agent.

5. 📦 Agent Output Schema
Every agent returns a consistent JSON structure:
{
  "agent": "sentiment",
  "candidates": ["Campaign A", "Campaign C"],
  "score": 0.82,
  "rationale": "Customers in Tier 1 express strong positivity towards shoes.",
  "evidence": [
    {
      "text": "Shoes on discount are trending in Delhi",
      "metadata": {"source": "twitter", "date": "2025-09-01"},
      "distance": 0.18
    }
  ]
}
	• agent → which agent produced it.
	• candidates → suggested campaigns/products.
	• score → confidence (decided by LLM).
	• rationale → short explanation.
	• evidence → top retrieved docs (optional, transparency).

6. 📤 Orchestrator → Marketer Input
The orchestrator bundles outputs into one package:
{
  "route": "sentiment+purchase",
  "agent_outputs": [ {sentiment agent output}, {purchase agent output} ]
}

7. 🎨 Marketer (Creative) Agent Output
Final new campaign idea (generative):
{
  "campaign_name": "Urban Shoe Rush",
  "product": "Shoes",
  "region": "Tier 1 Cities",
  "segment": "Young professionals (25-40)",
  "concept": "A loyalty-driven flash sale with 15% discounts on office shoes.",
  "channels": ["Email", "Push"],
  "content_brief": "Catchy subject lines like 'Step Into Style' with commuter lifestyle imagery."
}

8. 🖥 Demo Flow (Streamlit)
	1. User enters a query.
	2. Orchestrator routes it to the right agents.
	3. Agents query their RAG namespaces + run LLM analysis.
	4. Outputs (structured + evidence) → Marketer Agent.
	5. Marketer Agent generates a new campaign proposal.
	6. UI shows:
		○ Which agents ran.
		○ Their outputs.
		○ Final campaign idea.
		○ Optional flow diagram (Mermaid).

9. ⚡ Why It’s Powerful
	• Multi-agent orchestration (modular, scalable).
	• RAG + LLM synergy (retrieval for memory, LLM for reasoning).
	• Generative campaign ideation (not just ranking past results).
	• Hackathon-friendly (modular files, transparent outputs, UI demo).

✅ This document captures the full design without losing detail.
👉 Next step: I can now rewrite the code scaffold so it matches these improvements:
	• Agents using LLM to assign scores.
	• Passing evidence along with structured outputs.
	• Marketer Agent generating new campaign JSON.
Do you want me to go ahead and draft that updated codebase?
